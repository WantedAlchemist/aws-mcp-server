This project supports various use cases, including but not limited to:

- AI agent deployment
- Automation of cloud resources
- DevOps practices for enterprise applications

## Features

- **AI Agent Support**: Easily deploy AI agents that can interact with AWS services.
- **Automation**: Automate routine tasks to save time and reduce human error.
- **Cloud Integration**: Seamlessly connect with various AWS APIs.
- **Infrastructure Management**: Simplify the management of cloud resources.
- **Enterprise Ready**: Built with enterprise needs in mind, ensuring scalability and reliability.

## Installation

To get started with the AWS MCP Server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WantedAlchemist/aws-mcp-server.git
   cd aws-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Use your preferred package manager to install the required libraries.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration**:

   Configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "aws_access_key_id": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
     "aws_secret_access_key": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
     "region": "YOUR_REGION"
   }
   ```

4. **Run the server**:

   Execute the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

## Usage

After setting up the server, you can start using it for your applications. The server exposes several endpoints for interacting with AWS services.

### Example API Call

To demonstrate the functionality, here‚Äôs a simple example of how to make an API call to deploy an AI agent:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/deploy-agent -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "agent_name": "MyAI",
  "parameters": {
    "model": "GPT-3",
    "version": "latest"
  }
}'
```

This call will initiate the deployment of an AI agent named "MyAI" using the specified model.
